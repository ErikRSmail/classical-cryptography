I intend for this to eventually be a library to demo historical or outdated cryptography algorithms. 
It is intended to be read and understood rather than used for any practical cryptographic purpose.
The intended audience is c++ beginners (who are not brand new to programming or c++).
Efficiency will take a backseat to readability when they are in conflict. 

I want to brush up on my c++ OOP skills so there will be plenty of Boilerplate Driven Development. Please give feedback if you think I've done anything completely insane.

An idea I have (I have no clue if it's a good one) is to use OOP ideas to help illustrate some of the connections between different ciphers. eg: ceasar inherits from shift inherits from affine because a ceasar cipher IS a specialized unkeyed shift cipher, and a shift cipher IS a specialized affine cipher with a smaller key. 

Really gotta start to add descriptions of the algorithms at this point.......
